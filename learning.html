                                <h5>JavaScript is an interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript
                                    specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and
                                    multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based
                                    object-orientation, and first-class functions. In this path you will learn the
                                    basics of JavaScript as well as more advanced topics such as promises, asynchronous
                                    programming, proxies and reflection.</h5>
